THIS IS TIC TAC TOE!!

This is the read me for my first project for WDI.

This is a simple tic tac toe game, meant to be played with 2 local players around one system.  Each player picks a player piece either X or O, then each player takes turns selecting where to put a player piece on a simple 3 x 3 grid.

A player wins when they can get 3 in a row either verticaly, horizontialy or diagnoaly.

The players will tie if neither of them can make 3 in a row and fill the game board.

The game should be able to save progress and save win/loss records.
