WDI-PVD-03 Project #1 - Tic Tac Toe Extreme!
=================================================

OVERVIEW:
-------------

For my first project for WDI-PVD-03 I needed to create a Tic Tac Toe game, where a player can opt to create an account, sign-in, change password and then sign out.  Then play against another local user in a simple game of Tic Tac Toe (with an EXTREME twist!). My user stories were as follows:
    - A user can create a profile and then sign in and out of the program. 
    - the game will save the users game data that can be displayed when promted. 
    - The users can play a game of tic tac toe and be given feed back on who wins the game.
    - The game will display the amount of times the user has won on either the  ðŸ’¥ or ðŸ’£. 
    - When the game is over you can reset the gameboard by pressing the 'reset' button at the top of the screen. 

SOME PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------------
    
    - Must deploy this page to Github pages.
    - Must make frequent commits to control workflow and control flow. 
    - Create a well documented README file with all enclosed documentation.
    - Use and impliment an API, JQUERY and DOM minipulation. 

TECHNOLOGIES USED IN PROJECT:

    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - Bootstrap
    - Javascript 
    - JQuery 
    - Google Fonts 

HTML5 was used to create the basic structure of the game itself.  The game board, buttons, forms and content was created here.

I used Bootstrap to create the modal that houses the games discription in the upper right conner of the screen.

Javascript/Jquery was used to create the actual game logic and AJAX was used to create user data including sign-up/sign-in data and game data.
